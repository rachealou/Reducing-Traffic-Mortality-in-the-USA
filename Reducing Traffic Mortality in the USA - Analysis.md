**1. The raw data files and their format**  
We can open the data set needed for this analysis and by peaking into the types of independent variables and depedent variables provided in the general data sets. 

**2. Read in and get an overview of the data**  
We will peak now closer into the csv road-accidents.csv inside of datasets and obtain general information about this csv.

**3. Create a textual and a graphical summary of the data**  
Summary statistics for the csv is created. A pairplot is also created to  plot the pairwise relationship between each variable in the data set. A few examples would be drvr_fatl_col_bmiles with drvr_fatl_col_bmiles, perc_fatl_speed, perc_fatl_alcohol_, and perc_fatl_1st_time. There are n<sup>2</sup> pairwise graphs given n is the number of variables.

**4. Quantify the association of features and accidents**
Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient matrix which indicates the Pearson correlation coefficient which gives the statistical relationship between two continuous variables. From our data, perc_fatl_alcohol and perc_fatl_speed have the strongest statistical relationship wtih a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.286244.

**5. Fit a multivariate linear regression**

**6. Perform PCA on standardized data**  

**7. Visualize the first two principal components**

**8. Find clusters of similar states in the data**  

**9. KMeans to visualize clusters in the PCA scatter plot**  

**10. Visualize the feature differences between the clusters**  

**11. Compute the number of accidents within each cluster**  

**12. Make a decision there is no celar right choice**
