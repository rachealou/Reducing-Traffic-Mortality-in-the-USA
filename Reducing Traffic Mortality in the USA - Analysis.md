**1. The raw data files and their format**  
We can open the data set needed for this analysis and by peaking into the types of independent variables and depedent variables provided in the general data sets. 

2. Read in and get an overview of the data
We will peak now closer into the csv road-accidents.csv inside of datasets and obtain general information about this csv.

3. Create a textual and a graphical summary of the data

4. Quantify the association of features and accidents

5. Fit a multivariate linear regression

6. Perform PCA on standardized data

7. Visualize the first two principal components

8. Find clusters of similar states in the data

9. KMeans to visualize clusters in the PCA scatter plot

10. Visualize the feature differences between the clusters

11. Compute the number of accidents within each cluster

12. Make a decision there is no celar right choice
